# Purpose: Defines and runs the multi-container dev environment.
# This file lets us spin up our service AND its dependencies (like Redis)
# with a single command.

version: '3.8' # Use a modern version of compose

services:
  # Service 1: Our Strategy Engine (MS 4)

    build:
      context: . # Use the Dockerfile in the current directory

    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # Map host port 8000 to container port 8000
    environment:
      # --- IMPORTANT ---
      # This is how you pass secrets. NEVER hardcode them.
      # We'll add example env vars for Redis later.
      - REDIS_HOST=redis

    depends_on:
      - redis # Tell Docker to start Redis *before* starting our app
    volumes:
      # In dev, we mount our local 'app' directory into the container.
      # This enables 'hot-reloading'. You change code, the server restarts.
      - ./app:/app
    command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

  # Service 2: The Dialogue State Tracker (MS 3)
  redis:
    image: "redis:7-alpine" # Use a small, official Redis image
    container_name: ms3-redis-tracker
    ports:
      - "6379:6379" # Expose Redis on the host for debugging (optional)
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data # Persist Redis data

volumes:
